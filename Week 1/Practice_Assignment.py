# Q1. Write a program to check if a given character is a vowel or a consonant.

# x1 = input("Enter any alphabet character: ")

# if x1 == "a" or x1 == "e" or x1 == "i" or x1 == "o" or x1 == "u":
#     print("The character you've entered is a VOWEL")
# else:
#     print("The character you've entered is a CONSONENT")


# Q2. Write a program to check if a given number is even or odd.

# x1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# if x1 % 2 == 0:
#     print("Even")
# else:
#     print("Odd")


# Q3. Write a program to check if a given number is a multiple of 3 and 5.

# x1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# if x1 % 3 == 0 and x1 % 5 == 0:
#     print("The number is a multiple of 3 and 5")
# else:
#     print("The number is not a multiple of 3 and 5")


# Q4. Write a program to compare two numbers and print the larger number.

# x1 = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
# x2 = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))

# print(f"The larger number is: {max(x1, x2)}")
